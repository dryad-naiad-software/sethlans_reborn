.SYNOPSIS
    This script automates the creation of a new project and a variety of render jobs for manual stress testing.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script submits a heavy workload to stress-test the Sethlans Reborn system. It creates a new project,
    uploads all necessary assets, and then queues a diverse set of 7 render jobs, including:
    - A standard single-frame CPU job.
    - A long multi-frame animation job (HD 720p).
    - A high-quality, GPU-accelerated tiled render job (Full HD 1080p).
    - An animation job using the 'frame_step' feature.
    - A GPU-accelerated TILED ANIMATION job.
    - A high-sample CPU-only tiled job.
    - An EEVEE-based animation.
