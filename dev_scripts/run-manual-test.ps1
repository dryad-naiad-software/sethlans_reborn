# This script automates the creation of a new project and a variety of render jobs for manual testing.
# It now submits a heavier workload to stress-test the system:
# 1. A standard single-frame CPU job (low quality).
# 2. A long multi-frame animation job (HD 720p).
# 3. A high-quality, GPU-accelerated tiled render job (Full HD 1080p).
# 4. An animation job using the 'frame_step' feature over a long sequence.
# 5. A GPU-accelerated TILED ANIMATION job (new).
