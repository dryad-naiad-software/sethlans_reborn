--- START OF PROJECT CODE DUMP MANIFEST AND INSTRUCTIONS ---
Timestamp: 2025-07-24 01:13:11

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING THIS CODEBASE:**
1. **READ THIS MANIFEST FIRST.** It provides an overview and list of chunks.
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MANIFEST.** Confirm you understand the process.
3. **REQUEST CHUNKS SEQUENTIALLY.** After acknowledging, ask for the content of 'project_code_chunk_01.txt', then 'project_code_chunk_02.txt', and so on, until all chunks listed below have been provided.
4. **CONFIRM RECEIPT OF EACH CHUNK.** After each chunk is provided, please acknowledge that you have received and processed its content before requesting the next.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
Project Name: Sethlans Reborn - Distributed Blender Rendering System
Core Goal: Leverage multiple worker machines for Blender rendering jobs.
Architecture: Consists of a Django Manager (Backend) and Python Worker Agents (Clients).
Development Focus: Currently focusing on building out and unit testing the **backend functionality**. The **frontend will eventually be written in Angular**.

**CURRENT CODEBASE STATE:**
This dump contains all .py, .ini, and .txt files from the project as of the timestamp above.
The unit test suite for the 'sethlans_worker_agent' components is partially complete and currently stable (passing 6 tests in test_tool_manager.py and others).
The last complex test we were working on ('generate_and_cache_blender_download_info' in tool_manager.py) was paused due to intricate mocking issues, so that test (Test 7 in test_tool_manager.py) is NOT expected to pass in the current code, but is stable in the previous commit. We will revisit it later.
